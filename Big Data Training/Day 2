- Store Resource Stats: -> YARN -> yet Another resource negotiator.
	- Stores stats of available resources on node,
	- e.g. RAM, CPU cores, Disk.
	- Everything in yarn is configured in form of containers.
	
- Before a dept in organization requests data it should communicate with resource stats for the data. -> gate keeping. -> So that all the depts should have access to the cluster.

- HDFS -> MapReduce -> common libs -> PIG (Declarative programming lang that converts to mapR logic) 
								   -> HIVE (Relational db, Run SQL queries on hadoop for analysts.) 
								   -> SPARK (Supports in-memory map reduce operation, avoids writting the results to disk everytime.) -> All these talk to yarn by default to get resources and containers and data storage.
								   
- Cludera, Hortenworks, MapR, IBM -> HADOOP destributions.

- Application Managers: Communicate with YARN to have all resources available in sync.
- Data Engineer (Getting data from sources, save to data lake, apply business logic), Data scientist (Deduce insights out of the stored data.), 
	DevOps (Make sure the systems are up and running.).
